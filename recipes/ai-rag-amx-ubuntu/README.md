# Gen AI RAG DEMO using Xeon AMX

## Description 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data sources. This application allows users to select a popular large language model, a specific RAG dataset, and query a question to the LLM to showcase an LLM RAG's capability. To enhance efficiency, the application leverages Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions Technology (AMX). AMX provides specialized instructions for matrix multiplication, convolution, and linear algebra operations to reduce latency, a crucial aspect for chat based LLMs.
