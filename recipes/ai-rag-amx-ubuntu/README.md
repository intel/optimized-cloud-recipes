# Gen AI RAG DEMO using Xeon AMX

## Description 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the capabilities of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data sources. 

This application allows users to select a popular large language model, a specific RAG dataset, and query a question to the LLM to showcase an LLM RAG's capability. Users can explore and evaluate the responses of the following models: 

 Mistral OpenOrca FineTune - Chat Based | 7B Parameters | MistralAI Trained | 
 Orca2 - Instruction Based | 13B Parameters | Microsoft Trained | 
 Llama2 - Instruction Based | 13B Parameters | Nous Research Trained | 
 GPT4ALL Snoozy - Instruction Based | 13B Parameters | NomicAI Trained | 

 Models were 

To enhance efficiency, the application leverages Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions Technology (AMX). AMX provides specialized instructions for matrix multiplication, convolution, and linear algebra operations to reduce latency, a crucial aspect for chat based LLMs.
